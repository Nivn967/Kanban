# Kanban
In this project, me and 2 other students implemented a management methodology that allows for organizing and prioritizing projects and their tasks, using boards, lists, and cards.with a kanban, managers can focus on managing and prioritizing the teamâ€™s tasks, keep the team in the loop, and control a steady workflow. This tool supports agile development and helps visualizing and managing the workflow.

This code is written in C#, including a full backened and a partial frontend implementation.
